# Commodore 64 Pong in basic

I recently decided I would learn how to write basic scripts for my c64, with the ultimate goal of learning how assembler works. I figured a pong clone might be a good way to start and would be something other beginners might be interested in. I am completely new to coding for the C64 and welcome any feedback you have.

### version

0.9 It is currently very crude and runs quite slow in basic. Im sure the code could be more efficient.
